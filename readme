Unplatfrom-DataFomrating is a script which will be used for formatting the data that is extracted by the Unplatform data extraction script.

For formatting the data we will be using a python script. The idea for formating the data is to parse all the json files recieved from the school 
using python json module and then extracting the required fields from this json files nd writing this feilds to a csv in a tubulated 2D form.
